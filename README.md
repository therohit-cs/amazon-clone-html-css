# amazon-clone-html-css
This is a simple clone of the Amazon website made using only HTML and CSS. I created this project to practice my frontend skills like layout design, using Flexbox, and styling elements. It’s a basic version, just for learning purposes—not connected to any backend or real shopping features.
