# Amazon Clone (HTML + CSS)

This is a simple front-end clone of the Amazon homepage created using only **HTML** and **CSS**.  
It's meant to help me practice web layout, styling, and organizing a basic project — especially for beginners like me.

> 🚨 This project is static and for learning purposes only — it does not include back-end functionality.
